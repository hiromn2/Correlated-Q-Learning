# Correlated-Q-Learning
Advanced ML Project: does Q-learning algorithm learn correlated equilibrium if given the right messages?


Modifications in the Code:
1. Message is private, so need to condition the actions for the private messages, which intensely complicated the code. This part was done by me
2. Changed exploration policy


Title and Project Description
Table of Contents
Features:
Highlight key capabilities of your Q-learning project (e.g., exploration strategies, environment setup, any custom reward structure).
If your project uses frameworks or libraries, mention them briefly. Ex:
## Features
- Stateless Q-learning approach that stores action values without explicit states.
- Configurable hyperparameters (learning rate, discount factor, exploration rate).
- Simple environment simulation for quick iterations.
- Easy-to-extend architecture for other RL experiments.

8. Results
What to include:

Charts or tables showing performance metrics (like reward per episode).
Before/after comparison if applicable.
Screenshots or short GIFs if your environment is visual.
