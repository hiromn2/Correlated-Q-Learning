# Q-Learning with Messages
Advanced ML Project: does Q-learning algorithm learn correlated equilibrium if given the right messages? 

##Features
- Stateless Q-learning approach that stores action values without explicit states.
- Variation of the benchmark algorithm by Q-values being conditional on a message
- Optional decreasing exploration Boltzmann policy
- The code was written from scratch with the help of Chat GPT to solve minor issues
